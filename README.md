# GDTKLIB
A basic toolkit to develop Godot games. It includes all the tools that I have developed and other add-ons to speed up GameJams.

# AbilitySystem
My framework for developing multiplayer games. The system separates the data into the AbilityAttribute and AbilityAttributeTag. It still lacks client-side prediction and server reconciliation.
- AbilityAttribute contains the float data and controls the logic of replication and iteration.
- AbilityAttributeTag is a dictionary that can be used by each ability to check whether that ability is usable. It is also used with AnimationTree.
